## Hi 👋, I'm Shrey Shah

---

A passionate **AI Software Engineer** at **Vivun**, dedicated to crafting intelligent systems that transform how we interact with technology. My work involves building advanced **Generative AI** solutions, leveraging **multi-agent workflows**, **knowledge graph-based recommendations**, and **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**. With a strong foundation in **Python**, **LangChain**, **LangGraph**, **FastAPI**, and experience with tools like **Hugging Face**, I strive to push the boundaries of what's possible with AI.

When I'm not immersed in the world of AI, I'm exploring the latest tech gadgets, experimenting with **Stable Diffusion** and **ComfyUI**, or diving into **VR gaming** with my Oculus Quest 3. I'm also a Marvel and DC enthusiast, a photography hobbyist with my Canon M50 Mark II, and a Pixel 7 Pro aficionado.
